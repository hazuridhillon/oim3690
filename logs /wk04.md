####### session 7 below 

##what ive learned this week 
image code has end tage becuase the image opens and closes and has its own stuff within it, so no text just images

if you dont have the https/www. inf front of the website name in your html code, it will try and giet the file from the web still 

realtive path, where the file is relative to where you currently are?

having two <h1> is okay but not recommended since its the header ansd so if there are multuple you will just have multiple headers 

semantic html - 
header <header>
nabv bar <nav>
main conent <main>


##code im proud of 

##chalenges ive faced

##AI usage

i used the chatbot to make my record site it was much easier than i thought however custiomizing it to have the correct ptuicturees and songs took longer than antiicpated and is quite hard to do, i cant imagive having to do the whole coding proccess like this. 

##questions going forward
i did not understnad the file structre that you were trying to teach us with the telp folder nad putting in a link using relative path - im still cponfused on when thats beneficial
